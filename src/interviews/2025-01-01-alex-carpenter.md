## Who are you and what do you do?

Hey I am Alex, I am a UI Engineer from Grand Rapids, MI and I am the original creator of the I Brew My Own Coffee "brand" that started back in 2014 as a podcast but has now returned as a weekly newsletter.

## What does your brewing setup look like?

Every morning starts by pulling a shot of espresso from our Breville Barista Touch Espresso Machine. While sipping on my shot, I will start to prepare a pot of coffee for my wife and I using our Moccamaster Coffee Maker. For many years, we'd brew our coffee by hand with a Kalita Wave which brews one of the best tasting coffees in my opinion. However, since becoming parents, our mornings seem to be a little bit more unpredictable and a pot of coffee that can stay warm for a while is the most ideal.

## What is your prefered brewing method?

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Nulla, eius. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Nulla, eius.

## Lastly, any coffee bean recommendations?

Since it is local to us, and a place my wife worked at for many years, I have to suggest [Madcap Coffee](https://www.madcapcoffee.com/) here in Grand Rapids, MI.
