## Who are you and what do you do?

I’m Jason Long and I’m a product designer working for PlanetScale. I live in Columbus, Ohio and I work from home.

## What does your brewing setup look like?

I have a LaMarzocco Mini R espresso machine and the matching Pico grinder. The Mini’s portafilter has a removable double spout and I have that off and go bottomless.

For my scale, I use a Acaia Pearl but I’m not sure I need all the features since the Mini has a built in shot clock. My leveling tool, tamper, and WDT tool are all from Normcore and the mat is a cheapo from Amazon. The knock box is from a company called homeffect. I have a few different cups from over the years, but I’m mostly using the LaMarzocco cups I recently received as a gift.

I also have a Technivorm coffee machine that is mostly used by my wife these days.

## What is you preffered brewing method?

I’ll sometimes make a Cortado, but 90% of the time I’m making a flat white. I grind 17g of beans and try to pull a 34g shot in 25-30 seconds. I’ll steam 2% or whole milk and pour some amateurish latte art.

## Lastly, any coffee bean recommendations?

I’ve been using [Monach](https://onyxcoffeelab.com/products/monarch?variant=31861823176802) beans from [Onyx](https://onyxcoffeelab.com/) for several months and I really enjoy them.
