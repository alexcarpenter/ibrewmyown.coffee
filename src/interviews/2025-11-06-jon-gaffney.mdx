## Who are you and what do you do?

I’m Jon, I live in the short coastal region of New Hampshire. I grew up doing all sorts of outdoors activities and got really into sports. Today, I try to get as much time as I can outside moving, training, or having fun on the water with my partner or friends. I love working with my hands, building things, improving my house, and crafting projects (Sashiko, zines, etc.) I used to photograph concerts in another stage of life, now I just try to get to see a show a month or so.

To pay the bills I work in the marketing agency world as a strategist. It can be a bit opaque as to what that means, or what I “do”. In effect, I figure out the plan for brands to sell their wares to the right people, at the right times, with the right messages.

## What does your brewing setup look like?

I have a lot of different brewing methods available. I got into coffee on a year long road trip around the country with my partner a decade ago, and since then I’ve kept growing and evolving my capabilities, both in the equipment, and in the gear. I don’t have the best of everything, but I have what works well and performs for our use case with only two people in the house. I have equipment for brewing and for espresso.

## What is you preffered brewing method?

## Lastly, any coffee bean recommendations?
