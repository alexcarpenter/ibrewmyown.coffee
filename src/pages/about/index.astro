        I Brew My Own Coffee got its start in 2014 when Alex Carpenter launched
        it as a podcast. Instead of focusing on coffee professionals, the show
        wanted to shine a light on everyday coffee enthusiasts and their home
        brewing setups. The podcast really hit its stride when Brian Beyke and
        Bryan Schiele took over, even snagging the Sprudge award for best coffee
        podcast in 2016.

        Though the podcast ended, there are still tons of people out there who
        love brewing great coffee at home. That's why we're bringing back "I
        Brew My Own Coffee" as a weekly newsletter where we'll share cool home
        coffee setups from real people like you.
