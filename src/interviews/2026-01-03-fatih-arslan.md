## Who are you and what do you do?

Hi, I'm Fatih Arslan. I'm a Software Engineer working for a SF based company called PlanetScale. I'm living with my lovely wife and two kids in Ankara, Turkey. I'm a huge design nerd, and have a special interest in Industrial Design and Furniture.

## What does your brewing setup look like?

I have several setups depending on my mood. The main method is my Linea Mini, paired with a Weber Key MK2. I set it up so that it automatically turns on every morning at 8am, so it's always ready for me whenever I wake up. I love Weber Workshops and have also their recently released Tamper and Bean Cellars. I always weigh my beans upfront so I know how much I'll be using. And for the shot itself I use an Acaia Lunar.

Sometimes I decide to make filter coffee. For that I have a Comandante MK40 grinder that I exclusively use for grinding my filter coffee beans. I use a Fellow EKG Kettle and depending on whether I want a small or large volume I brew my coffee with the Blue Bottle Dripper or a Kalita 155. I also have various other pour over devices, such as V60 or Hario Nel Drip. I especially use the Nel Drip for very dark roasts (Japanese osmotic style). My scale for pour overs is the Acaia Pearl

Lastly, we also have a Moccamaster filter machine, paired with a Fellow Ode grinder in our kitchen. That's when we want to brew in large batches and want to drink slowly over the day during weekends.

## What is you preffered brewing method?

I can say that 80% of the time it's making an Americano with my Linea Mini. If I want to drink some dark roast or something that doesn't finish immediately I do a pour over.

## Lastly, any coffee bean recommendations?

This is a hard question. I recently enjoyed Blue Bottle's Tokyo Kissa beans. They are Blue Bottle's darkest roast and reflects Japanese roasting styles. I really loved it, but I'm pretty bummed that it was a limited run.

Other than that I love what my local roaster, Milestones coffee is doing for me. And occasionally I got some coffee from the German's roasters Man vs Machine and The Barn that I enjoy a lot.
