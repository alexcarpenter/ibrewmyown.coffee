## Who are you and what do you do?

I’m a 30 something Digital Content Created based in Blackpool, UK, specialising in Design, Interiors, Personal Style, Lifestyle and Travel, with an emphasis on the creative community, discovery of smaller brands and culture. I work on bits on my own channel along with contributing to others like It’s Nice That, as well as creating photo, video and written content for brands.

## What does your brewing setup look like?

At home starts with a Commandante hand grinder, Timemore scales, various glass carafes (Kinto, Hay, Gramage, Service Projects), wooden + glass dripper by Service Projects or a white porcelain one created by a friend from Ireland, then a basic Hario long spout kettle.

I’ve usually got a few different filters on the go each week, just mixing them on each day and depending if anyone is popping around. Ceramics are a big deal for me, it’s something I’m pretty obsessed with, so we have something nice and tactile to go with the brews.

We also have a Sage Barista Express machine, which we usually run Atkinson’s espresso prototype through, but currently we have something on from A Matter of Concrete.

## What is you preffered brewing method?

I’m mainly a filter guy, so I’ll stick to that mainly if I’m at home on my own, but sometimes I’ll switch to espresso drinks in the afternoon. I tend to just drink black, and get my milky drinks outside the house. Baristas know the milk situ much better than me so I don’t even try.

## Lastly, any coffee bean recommendations?

Anything by Module (The guys from [Lowdown](https://www.lowdown.coffee/)), [AMOC](https://amatterofconcrete.com/), Fort of Manchester’s in-house roast. Also been drinking a lot of [Scenary](https://scenery.coffee/) as they’re on house at my local cafe Last Last, very much enjoying that. Sey is also one of my faves, if we’re talking worldwide.
