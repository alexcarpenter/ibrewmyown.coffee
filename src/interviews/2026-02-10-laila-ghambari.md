## Who are you and what do you do?

My name is Laila Ghambari and I am the owner of Guilder & Junior’s Roasted Coffee in Portland, Or. I run our coffee business (3 cafes & roastery I own with my husband) as well as my own coffee business consultancy.

## What does your brewing setup look like?

My home coffee setup has changed a lot over the years. My husband has worked for LaMarzocco and Synesso so often we have had an espresso machine, Linea Mini or ES1. The EK43 has been our trusted grinder for the last 10 years, it was a prize for winning the 2014 USBC. I switched it out for the EK43S a few years after getting it. Recently I pulled the grinder and espresso machines for a much more simple set up. Currently using a Timemore Sculptor 078 and brewing with an Origami brew.

## What is you prefered brewing method?

I prefer to use an automated coffee brewer at home. I’ve got 3 little kids so making coffee in the morning needs to be as easy as possible. I’ve used Bonavita & Breville, but my favorite is the Simply Good Coffee Brewer. I just use a Kalita Wave rather than the provided pourover attachment.

## Lastly, any coffee bean recommendations?

Well of course I think our coffee ([Junior's Roasted Coffee](https://juniorsroastedcoffee.com/collections/all)) is pretty delicious. The Ethiopia Habtamu Fikadu Aga is my go to at the moment.
