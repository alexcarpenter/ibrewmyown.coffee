## Who are you and what do you do?

An Arizona native with more than 13 years in Specialty Coffee, I honed my craft starting from behind the bar as a barista to leading coffee programs and developing education content.

While still an avid coffee enthusiast and home barista, I left the industry in 2019. Since then I’ve changed careers and am now a product manager at American Express.

More importantly, I am a husband and dad of six who loves building Lego, cooking, and crafting tropical cocktails when I’m not brewing coffee.

## What does your brewing setup look like?

For espresso, I’ve had the Breville Dual Boiler and a modded Mazzer Mini paired up for well over a decade. While they’re not the fanciest or most hyped gear on the market, together they’re a workhorse combo and make consistently good espresso.

For filter / pourover, I have a Baratza Preciso grinder and <Productcard id="fellow-stagg-ekg-electric-gooseneck-kettle" client:load>Fellow Stagg EKG kettle</Productcard>. While I’ve owned almost every coffee brewer and gadget on the market over the years, these days I primarily drink pourover coffee brewed on either a V60-01, Kalita 155, or a Gino dripper with a Hario glass decanter.

For both espresso and filter I have Acaia Pearl scales.

For drink wares I like:
- Not Neutral Lino Diner mug
- Not Neutral Lino Cappuccino and Espresso Cups
- Heath Ceramics - Modern Cup
- Acme Cappuccino Cups

## What is you preffered brewing method?

I like balance in the cup and find that pourover is generally my favorite daily drinker. I’ve been an almost exclusive fan of the V60 for a long time but lately been drinking a lot of coffee on the Kalita 155.

My go to recipe of late:
- 17 grams medium-fine ground coffee
- 250 grams RO filtered water (125 ppm)
- 212ºF

I make either a lightly sweetened iced latte or cappuccino on a daily basis for my wife and if I’m drinking espresso, it’s usually in a cappuccino.

Espresso specs:
- 19 grams in
- ~38 grams out
- 28 - 35 seconds

## Lastly, any coffee bean recommendations?

There are so many incredible roasters out there, it’s difficult to only highlight a few.

Recently, I’ve been subscribing to Sey Coffee. Their coffees are always on point with a focus on balance, clarity and sweetness.

For espresso I’ve been enjoying Sightglass Crown Point and Cat & Cloud The Answer.
