## Who are you and what do you do?

I'm Eric, I'm 44. I love movement and endurance-based competitions, particularly CrossFit strength training. I compete in my age group in High Rocks and CrossFit, as well as various endurance challenges each year, generally Leadville. Mountain biking is one of my favorite activities.

Professionally, I help build brands, working with many companies in the wellness space, particularly consumer packaged goods. I help them generate awareness through social media, community events, ambassador programs, and digital marketing funnels. I also invest in early-stage brands and help raise money for them.

## What does your brewing setup look like?

We have a Rocket Apartamento espresso machine, a Terra Cafe super automatic machine, and a Rocket Apartamento grinder.

## What is you preffered brewing method?

I prefer using the Rocket Apartamento, but we're using the Terra Cafe more often now due to its convenience - just hit a button and you have espresso. The Rocket Apartamento is more of a labor of love, requiring you to dial in the grind size each time we buy new beans.

## Lastly, any coffee bean recommendations?

Yes, quite a few:

- [Roast Umber](https://www.roastumber.com) out of Michigan
- [Onyx](https://onyxcoffeelab.com) from Bentonville, Arkansas - one of my favorites
- [Bird Rock Coffee Roasters](https://birdrockcoffee.com/) from San Diego
- [Counter Culture](https://counterculturecoffee.com) (great for Amazon same-day delivery)
- [Corvus](https://www.corvuscoffee.com/) here in Denver
- [Best Slope](https://bestslopecoffeeco.com/) from Fruta, Colorado

I have memories tied to various coffee shops I've visited over the years, with Onyx being particularly memorable.
